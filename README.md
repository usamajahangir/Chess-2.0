# Chess 2.0 ♟️
A sleek, GUI-based chess game built from scratch!

Welcome to **Chess 2.0**, a modern take on the timeless game of chess. Powered by Qt5, this project combines a polished interface with classic gameplay. Created as an academic semester project for "Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming," it’s a blend of learning, coding, and fun—perfect for chess lovers and programmers alike!

## 🚀 Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built with Qt5 for a smooth, responsive experience.
- **Classic Chess Gameplay:** All the rules you know, coded with precision.
- **Custom Chess Pieces:** Stunning designs by Maurizio Monge, converted from SVG to PNG.
- **OOP & Data Structures:** A practical showcase of programming concepts.

## 🎯 Why Chess 2.0?
We built this as our academic semester project for "Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming." Why a game? Because coding a chess app is the ultimate mix of challenge and fun! It’s a chance to apply OOP principles, wrestle with data structures, and create something we can play and share.
